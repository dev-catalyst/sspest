              Cafeterias, classrooms, locker rooms, gyms, school grounds and
              rubbish bins attract pests due to discarded or leftover food.
            </Need>
            <Need>
              Areas of schools can have poor ventilation, which can lead to
              pests.

              Damp environments like bathrooms can lead to cockroaches which
              spread diseases.

              Moths and other insects can congregate in cupboards and pantries

              Given the high density of students and staff, diseases from pests
              can spread quickly and lead to families being infected.

              Poor hygiene and pests can ruin a school reputation with families
              and the community.
